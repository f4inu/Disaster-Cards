# Rules:
You receive a disaster card and resource cards.
To solve your problem, you must use resource cards.
You can't use your own resource cards - you have to ask others!
To complete the challenge, you need between 3 and 10 resources (depending on difficulty).
Once you've asked for a resource, you can't ask the same team for another - you have to ask another team first.
Once a team has shared its card, it rejects it.

## Communication modes (depending on difficulty):
Use a different communication system for each contact:
- CW, AM, FM, SSB
- Digimodes: VARA, JS8Call, PSKMail, Rattlegram/Ribbit, etc.
- VHF/UHF direct, VHF/UHF relay, HF 6-10m, HF NVIS, HF relay

## Bonus/Malus cards :
- as the event intensifies, you need to double your resource cards
- event: you need another card, e.g. your generator breaks down, you need another generator card
- you get 1 card with 2 resources
- you get a resource card you can use

# Other disasters
- bridge collapse
- chemical gas
- cell phone and internet/telephone outrage
